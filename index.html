  <h2>Dataset</h2>

  <p>
    this dataset provides information about households in various counties of California, focusing on their technology usage, internet subscriptions, and household income. This data offers a comprehensive view of technology adoption, internet access, and income distribution among households in California,
     enabling further analysis and decision-making in various domains. 
     This data was created by the government. We are interested in it to 
     see the how technology plays a role in households now.<br/>

       and white serving as a midpoint. Notably, the white 
       gradient represents the value corresponding to the 
       lowest percentage of households without computers 
       in a 2015 county. Observing the 2022 map, it is evident 
       that the majority of the graph is shaded blue,

      Higher-income individuals were more likely to have internet subscriptions, with options including cellular data plans, 
      broadband, and satellite services.
      
      A visual comparison between Alameda and Sacramento counties showed that Alameda had higher household ownership of computing devices.
      
      Lastly, a map comparing California counties in 2015 and 2022 revealed a significant increase in computer ownership 
      over time, with most counties having lower percentages of households without computers in 2022 compared to 2015.
